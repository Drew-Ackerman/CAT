# C.A.T - Catastrophic Apocalypse Tracker
In the 60's the inhabitants of a group of islands were relocated so that nuclear weapons testing could take place. The islanders carried away all the valuables the could, but couldnt gather all their pets from the forests. The scientists and weapons experts assumed the nuclear blasts would obliterate any remaining life. However, due to some errors in the way the weapons were launched, the bombs detonated further away from the islands than predicted. Thus, unknown to the scientists, small colonies of cats were left behind. 

Many years later, the decendants of the islands inhabitants were allowed to resettle their homelands. The scientists told the inhabitants that satelite images and preliminary measurements had detected changes to the plants and small animals on the island, but that it was safe. As the boats landed on the sandy beach, the islanders were met by a group of cats. At first the islanders were suprised to still see cats their parents had when they were kids. What shocked them more was each cat had bright green eyes. 

## Purpose
This application allows researchers to track the progress of radiated cats and track their radiation and mood levels. 
This is vital because if the radiation and mood levels become critical then the cat can be contained until its levels are safe again.
